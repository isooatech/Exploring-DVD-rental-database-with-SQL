We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. 
The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.
For each category, there are movies who have maximum rentals. 
Create a query to get a percentage of the total rentals for each category contributed by the rentals of the highest renting movies.

Finally, for each of these top 10 paying customers, I would like to find out the difference across their monthly payments during 2007.
Please go ahead and write a query to compare the payment amounts in each successive month. Repeat this for each of these 10 paying customers. 
Also, it will be tremendously helpful if you can identify the customer name who paid the most difference in terms of payments.
